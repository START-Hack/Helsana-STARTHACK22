# START Hack 2022 - Helsana Case 

### Case Introduction
To have our users engage with our Helsana+ app even more, we want to build a system that recommends activities which the user can perform through the app. The recommendations can be based on a set of [sample data](HELSANA_DATASET_AND_ACCESS.md) that we provide and can be derived from a user's own existing data or also on other users' data.
